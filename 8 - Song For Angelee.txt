=====================================

~~INTRO
She dries your tears
And you ache inside when she's not here

~~VERSE
She makes you laugh and she makes you happy
you think about her from sunrise to sunset
The way she lives her life, the way she loves you
it leaves you forever in her Debt

~~CHORUS
And you give her your time
You give her your attention
along with all the love that you possess
and as you look into her eyes
you know she doesn't deserver any less
and she couldn't ask for anything
that you won't give to her
and while you are together...
Time Stands Still

~~VERSE
I'm ready now my hearts for the taking
too many times it's been given for the breaking
but this is different, this is heaven on earth
I see an angel right before my eyes

You Make me laugh and you make me happy
I think about you from sunrise to sunset
the way you live your life the way you love me
it leaves me forever in your debt

~~CHORUS
And I give you my time
I give you my attention
along with all the love that I possess
and as I look into your eyes
I know you don't deserve any less
and you couldn't ask for anything
that I won't give to you
and while we are together...
Time Stands Still

~~BRIDGE

~~OUTRO
You dry my tears
And I ache inside when you're not here
