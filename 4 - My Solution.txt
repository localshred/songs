==============================================

~~VERSE
Another Day, Another Week,
Another Life out of Control
And I can't figure out why inside my heart
there's still a hole

My actions have dug a pit
and my words have thrown me in
To the bottom I have gone,
I've screwed it up again

~~CHORUS
You were the only one who ever meant a thing to me
the only one that I truly believed could see
Just what's going on inside my head, inside my heart
Just what's going on inside my head, inside my heart

~~VERSE
Another day another hour
another minute without you
and I can't figure out
just exactly what I should do

my world has fallen
and the tears are dried
and I can't seem to replace
the emptiness that fills me up inside

your lies are laid bare
your words pierce my heart
yeah the heart you've held so long 
you've brutally torn apart

you see I've got this problem
the words still echo in my mind
"I didn't love you the same"
Inside my head they'll grind

~~CHORUS
You were the only one who ever meant a thing to me
the only one that I truly believed could see
Just what's going on inside my head, inside my heart
Just what's going on inside my head, inside my heart

~~BRIDGE

~~VERSE
This gravel road is long 
and filled with twists and turns
but the answer comes to those
who hopefully have learned

this day of mine
it wasn't made for you
it was made for me
and I've got lots to do

~~CHORUS
You were the only that ever meant a thing to me
but now you're gone, and I don't know what I should be
So please get out of my heart, and stay out of my way
I've got a sunrise that will heal your hurts,and I've brought myself to say

Bring on Another Day (repeat 4x)
