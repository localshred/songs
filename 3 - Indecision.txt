~~VERSE
I've never wanted anyone but you
You were my love, You were the perfect dream come true
And when I looked into your eyes I saw
Only You, there was nothing else at all

~~CHORUS
I thought you might've been the one
but it seems that you were only having fun
Was it meant to be? Were you just using me?
I need to know... Where are we?

~~BRIDGE 1

I'd see a lifetime through just to hold you near
but now I need to know just what is on your mind
do we still have a chance or maybe is it time?

I thought you might've been the one
but it seems that you were only having fun
Was it meant to be? Were you just using me?
I need to know...
