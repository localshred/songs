========================================================

~~VERSE
Sometimes when I'm Sitting There
Thinking of your Face
It's so Incredibly Beautiful
I'm Frozen by your Gaze

I feel that I'm inadequate
Of these feelings I can't address
But one thing I can tell you
Is Girl, I am...

~~CHORUS
Breathless
It's my one word to describe
Breathless
It's this love I have inside

and All that I can promise you
Is I'll be there for you
after all you've given me
It's all that I can do

~~VERSE
Your Love is Like a Latern
Shining in the Dark
Breaking through my outer wall
and straight into my heart

Everyday we walk the path
and now I must confess
through all our laughs and all our tears
I'm still....

~~CHORUS
