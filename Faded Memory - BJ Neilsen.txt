I'm writing this to you and it's really late, but I can't sleep because you've been on my mind. I saw you today, looking like you did the day I first met you, and it killed me inside. In only a moment every memory came back of you and all I could do was leave. Now it's 1 am and I can't get you out of my head, and the pain I feel is the kind that doesn't just go away. I've wanted to ask for so long, but didn't know how: Where did I go wrong, what did I do, and why aren't you with me tonight? Why did you leave, and How had everything you said to me turn into lies? You told me to my face that night that it never would have worked. You sat safely on your side of the car and told me I meant nothing to you. Well today I remembered everything about what you meant to me, and the questions rolled through my mind again. I attack the wall because nothing else will ease the pain, but when it's all said and done, you're still not here. After all the things that I think about, the one question that I really need answered, Do you ever think about me, or am I someone you've forgotten? The heated words I've said were just a front for the searing pain that I feel, the realization that you are gone and I don't know why.
