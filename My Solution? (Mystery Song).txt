"My Solution"

well i feel there's something wrong with my life 
but that's the way it should be i really hate it when i lie to you 
but what does the truth mean to me well what went wrong 
your back is turned again is this the beginning or the end 
is this all wrong you are more than a friend such a position 
that i'm in well you know i'm trying so hard to live my life without you 
and i tried so hard i got you now inside my heart it kills fueled by your love 
in the end i'll call your name i'm letting go it's time for you to know 
that all this time i've been so wrong i'm letting go the time's more fast 
than slow and everything is there for you well you know 
when i go away from you i lose control 
my body is feeling cold like a winter day then i close my eyes a picture 
so clear then i close my eyes
