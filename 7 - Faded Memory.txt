=====================================

~~VERSE
I'm writing this letter to you and it's really late
But I cannot sleep because you've been on my mind
I saw you today looking like the day that I first met you
and it killed me inside

In only a moment every memory came back of you
and all that I could do was leave
Now it's 1 am and I can't get you out of my head
And the Pain that I feel is the kind that just doesn't go away

~~PRE-CHORUS
I've wanted to ask you for so long
But I just didn't know how to say

~~CHORUS
Where did I go wrong, and what did I do, and Why aren't you with me tonight?
Why did you leave, and How did everything you say to me turn into lies?
You told me to my face that it never would have work and that you weren't in love with me
You sat safely on your side of the car and told me that I meant nothing to you

~~POST-CHORUS
Well Today I remembered everything about what you mean to me
and the questions rolled through my mind one more time

~~VERSE
I attack the wall, cause nothing else will ease the pain
but when it's all said and done, you're still not in my arms
Still there's one question that I really need you to answer
Do you ever think about me, or am I someone you've forgotten

~~PRE-CHORUS
The heated words I've said were just a front for the searing pain that I feel
It's the realization that you are gone and I don't know why

~~CHORUS
It's impossible to see myself caring as deeply about someone else as I did for you
I don't want to give my love to somebody else, I'm afraid that they'll do what you did
And I'm afraid I won't be able to love them like I loved you, I thought I was done with this
I thought it was all over and I haven't thought about it, for a long, long time.

~~POST-CHORUS
But seeing you brought everything back
All the good times, the love I STILL feel, and the pain that you've caused

~~BRIDGE 1
And a year has gone by and you're building your life far away from the world that I call my own
I won't send you this letter,
I won't get my answers,
and it SUCKS to be your Faded Memory...
Sincerely, Someone You've Forgotten

~~CHORUS
Where did I go wrong, and what did I do, and Why aren't you with me tonight?
Why did you leave, and How did everything you say to me turn into lies?
You told me to my face that it never would have work and that you weren't in love with me
You sat safely on your side of the car and told me that I meant nothing to you

~~BRIDGE 2

~~OUTRO
Now it's time for me to stand Strong
It's kinda funny it's good you're not coming home
and now it's your turn to be the Faded Memory
and become someone I've Forgotten
