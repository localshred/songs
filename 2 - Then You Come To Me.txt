================================

~~VERSE
They all talk about us saying it will never be
but they can't see our love or the way you look at me
and when I'm all alone and doubts run through my mind
I think about your face and I leave those doubts behind

PRE CHORUS
And Then You Come To Me!

~~CHORUS
With that laugh of yours
Your Smile, Your Eyes
And the Way you say my name
The way I've always known
But in Different Ways I can't Explain

Finding words to say:
Your Touch, Your Kiss
And the way you hold my hand
the way I've always known,
But in ways that I don't understand

~~VERSE
I think about you every minute I'm awake
and even in my sleep dreams of you I can't escape
I wish to have you mine, no "Death Do Us Part"
I'll give you everything, but Mainly just my Heart

Here come those thoughts again
I wish that they would leave
You would always be with me
If you could just believe

~~PRE CHORUS
And you prove me wrong again!
