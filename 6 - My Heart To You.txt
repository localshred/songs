==========================================================

~~VERSE
I'm pretty sure you've always been there
Sitting just outside my reach
And I have tried so hard not to stare
But you have come to me

Where this will go, I think we can't say
It's best just to let it be
All I know is I want to see your face
at the End of every day

~~CHORUS
And I've got these words burning through my head
"Oh won't you come be with me"
And I can't describe in words all my feelings
But I want you to come inside so you can see

~~BRIDGE

~~VERSE
I would do anything, I'd do what it takes
Just to make you happy, just to be with you
But you'll probably never hear this song
It's the words of my heart to you

~~CHORUS
And I've got these words burning through my head
"Oh won't you come be with me"
And I can't describe in words all my feelings
But I want you to come inside so you can see

~~BRIDGE
