==========================

hello my friend
it's been a long time
and to my surprise
you're in my arms tonight

and there is so much to do
so much to see
so much to show you
so much you can be

~~CHORUS 1
But why am I so lucky
to be holding you tonight
If there's anything wrong
I can make it alright 

On your First Night With Us

a soft lullaby
a child fast asleep
in the very next room
are two parents who weep

they're tears of joy
not of hurt or of pain
for this little creation
that we've given a name

~~CHORUS 2
But why are we so lucky
to be holding you tonight
if there's anything wrong
we can make it alright

~~BRIDGE
Ten priceless Fingers
Ten rounded Toes
a face that can melt you
with the touch of her nose

~~CHORUS 2
But why are we so lucky
to be holding you tonight
if there's anything wrong
we can make it alright
