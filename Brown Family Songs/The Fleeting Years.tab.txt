VERSE 1:
Years of our childhood, happy and gay;
Years of our youth-time, merry with play;
Years of our manhood, covered with care;
Years when there cometh silvery hair.

CHORUS:
Swiftly and Silently (x3)
Onward they roll
Each one is bring us (x3)
Nearer the goal

VERSE 2:
Winters of sadness, sickness and death;
Springtime of gladness, singing and mirth;
Summers of sunshine, covered with flowers
Autumns of richness, golden their hours.

VERSE 3:
Courage then Christian mourn not their flight,
Bravely press onward, Home is in sight.
Straight through those portals, toil shall be done,
Sin shall be vanquished, Christ shall be won.

CHORUS
